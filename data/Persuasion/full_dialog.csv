It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing.

12,"Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right? And that's really good to know you got help when you needed it.

Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.,4,0,20180904-091237_363_live

We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away.

9,That is awesome.,4,1,20180904-004818_580_live

12,"That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.",6,0,20180904-004818_580_live

14,"Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to ""fundraising, management, and general"" as the website says.  That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets.",7,0,20180904-004818_580_live
15,"Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.",7,1,20180904-004818_580_live
16,Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?,8,0,20180904-004818_580_live
17,Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.,8,1,20180904-004818_580_live
18,"That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?

5,"Yes, it does.",2,1,20180904-153641_72_live

15,"What percent of donations go to staff, administrative costs, etc.?",7,1,20180904-153641_72_live
16,9 of every 10 dollars goes directly to children in need! So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar! ,8,0,20180904-153641_72_live
17,How is the money distributed? Who precisely is performing the relief help?,8,1,20180904-153641_72_live
18,Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you.,9,0,20180904-153641_72_live

3,Agreed.  We try to actually know people involved before we give regularly.,1,1,20180904-152519_728_live
4,"That\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of ""Save the Children""? I worked with them in Greece; they operate in refugee camps and other high-risk zones to address specifically the needs of kids",2,0,20180904-152519_728_live
5,I have heard of them.  They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...,2,1,20180904-152519_728_live
6,"Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. ",3,0,20180904-152519_728_live
7,Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  ,3,1,20180904-152519_728_live
8,It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school,4,0,20180904-152519_728_live
9,What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  ,4,1,20180904-152519_728_live
10,"Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday",5,0,20180904-152519_728_live
11,Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?,5,1,20180904-152519_728_live
12,"I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there.

I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right? ",6,0,20180904-152519_728_live

15,"I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.",7,1,20180904-152519_728_live
16,Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org? It provides info on tons of organizations around the world ,8,0,20180904-152519_728_live
17,No - actually we don't LOOK for places to give - they just happen with people we get involved with/ and through our church.  I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?,8,1,20180904-152519_728_live
18,"Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me. I got involved with Save the Children because I was working with a local NGO in Greece and we partnered with them frequently for English classes and kid's activities and safety",9,0,20180904-152519_728_live

14,"Never discount the small donations, they add up over time. Larger donations make a bigger impact (of course!) but not many people are able to donate such a big chunk at a time.

2,I am doing absolutely wonderful! Do you have any children or nieces\\nephews?  ,1,0,20180831-211050_995_live
3,I have none of the above. Do you? ,1,1,20180831-211050_995_live
4,I do I just had a beautiful little baby girl. She is now 1 month old. ,2,0,20180831-211050_995_live
5,That's wonderful.  Congratulations. I would like to come back to that if there is enough time. What social issue are we supposed to be discussing? I don't see that information anywhere. ,2,1,20180831-211050_995_live
6,I was just leading into that. To be honest I could never imaging if anything happened to my daughter. And there are some non governmental organizations out there that help children like my daughter who are in trouble in developing countries. Would you like to know more about this organization?,3,0,20180831-211050_995_live
7,Of course. ,3,1,20180831-211050_995_live
8,This organization is called Save the Children. They provide relief and help support any child in need in developing countries. They go where they are needed. Personally I think this organization is needed especially being a new father I know how vulnerable children are now. And sometimes they just need help. ,4,0,20180831-211050_995_live
9,"Sounds like a noble cause, for sure. People need as much help as they can raising a child, I think. ",4,1,20180831-211050_995_live
10,Absolutely! I can attest to that! Organizations like this primarily operate off of donations. Have ever contributed to non profit organizations?,5,0,20180831-211050_995_live
11,"Indeed I have. I do it as much as I can, which is admittedly not as much as I would like to. ",5,1,20180831-211050_995_live
12,I know what you mean! sometimes it is hard to find the extra time or money to help those that need it. ,6,0,20180831-211050_995_live
13,"Definitely. If I wasn't worrying about getting by so much myself, I would be able to do much more. It's very rewarding. Gives you a great feeling inside. ",6,1,20180831-211050_995_live
14,Would you be willing to entertain the idea of donating some or all of the 2 dollar bonus received by completing this hit?,7,0,20180831-211050_995_live
15,"I would prefer to keep the bonus this time, given how bad my finances are at the moment. I'm sure you understand. ",7,1,20180831-211050_995_live
16,I absolutely do. Even the smallest amount would go a long way in helping this organization. I was thinking of doing even .15 of my bonus to this organization. That way I still get a majority of my bonus and hopefully others will donate as well so those tiny amounts add up so something of value for Save the Children.,8,0,20180831-211050_995_live
17,"Well, to tel you the truth, there is another reason I don't want to do it.  I like to vet charities extensively before I donate to them. As a result, I have a preferred list of charities that I give to regularly. I don't have time to properly vet this one at the moment. ",8,1,20180831-211050_995_live
18,That is understandable. My thought is its only .15 of my bonus and it would take more time to vet the organization then the donation is worth. Sometimes you have to go with that gut feeling and looking at my daughter sleeping right now I do not want any child to go without help that needs it. ,9,0,20180831-211050_995_live

8,Charity such as this does not actually pull people out of poverty.,4,0,20180828-145857_925_live
9,Well it does help somewhat. I don't think that anything will pull people completely out of poverty. It's a hand up.,4,1,20180828-145857_925_live
10,It is good on a basic humanitarian level. The money could be far better spent in opening up their native countries to the global system of trade. The west has spent trillions in aid over the last 60 years in Africa and do not have anything to show for it.,5,0,20180828-145857_925_live
11,That is true. The poor are barely left to survive while the rich get richer. It's a sad truth.,5,1,20180828-145857_925_live
12," There is nothing morally wrong with the rich getting richer. In the last 10 years those rich people have invested in the global trade system and brought over a billion people out of the world poverty threshold. In the world there is an elite segment of the population that provides most of the value for society, they should be the ones with the lion share of the resources. This is because the only way they can obtain a large amount of wealth in the first place is to make hundreds, thousands, and millions of mutually beneficial transactions.",6,0,20180828-145857_925_live
13,That's a valid point. What do you think can help?,6,1,20180828-145857_925_live
14,Greater free trade between countries and the ability for poor people to have access to sources of micro finance and capital goods so that many of them can invest in tools that make themselves more productive and cap dig their way out of poverty. ,7,0,20180828-145857_925_live
15,That would be good for the world. There's no reason for us to not have free trade really. I think most people would give anything to get out of poverty if given a chance.,7,1,20180828-145857_925_live

I wanted to get a feel for whether your interests tended to be focused on people, environment, etc. and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned for people's well-being.

Have you heard of Save the Children?",1,0,20180828-192913_631_live
3,It souns vaguely familiar does it help children in this country,1,1,20180828-192913_631_live
4,one of the beautiful things about it is that it helps children in the US AND around the world. (I myself sometimes get a bit discouraged or feel like my personal donations don't mean as much if its reach is too localized. Especially when it's something as important as helping and in many cases rescuing children from violent areas or from malnutrition/disease. Thousands of children die every day due to circumstances that are completely outside of their control and this organization actually helps to provide them with stability which eventually will better our global future.,2,0,20180828-192913_631_live

10,"I understand completely and I hope your son is doing better and continues to stay healthy! From what I'm seeing, the donation gets deducted from the task payment and even though it seems like a small donation (in the grand scheme of things) they put 90% of donations to direct aid so every dollar really adds up",5,0,20180828-192913_631_live

16,"That's a great idea. I would too even if it's a small percentage. This is on a similar topic but not directly related, but just in case you shop on Amazon and didn't know-- if you shop through smile.amazon.com you can actually choose a charity that gets a portion of donations on the money you spent. Doesn't cost you extra, I'm sure there are ones devoted to breast cancer!",8,0,20180828-192913_631_live
17,wow I didn't know at all.  Is that an app or a direct website?,8,1,20180828-192913_631_live

5,In that case I would not donate my money.  Every charity that has ever existed said the money would go towards a good cause.  I know nothing about Save the Children other than what you've just told me.,2,1,20180828-185623_74_live
6,"Well the organization does have consultative ties to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  They provide aid to children for education, health care, economic opportunities, along with emergency aid during natural disasters, war and other conflicts.

13,"That looks like a great organization. But I have to be clear, I've studied the wrong doings of large institutions, and there is potential for the funds to line somebody's pockets, instead of helping more. For example, even good organizations pay companies to solicit for them, those companies keep 85-90% of all donations.  I'm not taking a chance.",6,1,20180828-185623_74_live

3,I think it depends on the charity. I think there is sometimes charities that are not as transparent about where the donations go. ,1,1,20180825-080452_233_live
4,so some charities steal and some do the gods work?,2,0,20180825-080452_233_live
5,I don't know that I would consider it stealing. I think that some charities use funds for things other than direct support. I think it is the donaters responsibility to research ahead of their donation,2,1,20180825-080452_233_live
6,if they get couch what would be the sentence? ,3,0,20180825-080452_233_live

8,"the firs question, If they got caught stealing from a charity?",4,0,20180825-080452_233_live
9,If they got caught stealing from a charity they should go to jail. For how long depends on how much money they stole though,4,1,20180825-080452_233_live
10,and if they dont manage the funds correctly ?,5,0,20180825-080452_233_live
11,I don't think there should be a legal punishment for that. That would result in them losing their position,5,1,20180825-080452_233_live
12,you think that the money managing and where the money go must be transparent?,6,0,20180825-080452_233_live

9,That's a thought. I guess I could do that. Maybe 1/2 of the payment. ,4,1,20180825-075630_493_live
10,That is wonderful! So you are willing to donate half of your payment? I will also donate mine.,5,0,20180825-075630_493_live

7,I like the sound of that.  Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?,3,1,20180825-065106_23_live
8,"he money goes to the charity as a whole not to a particular kid, so when you donate you know you helping more than one child.",4,0,20180825-065106_23_live

1,"Hi.  I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?",0,1,20180825-054948_621_live
2,Oh. There is this children's charity my friend volunteers for. It's called Save the Children. Have you heard of it?,1,0,20180825-054948_621_live
3,I think so.  Does it have commercials on tv?  ,1,1,20180825-054948_621_live
4,"Yes, they do. I wish they didn't have to spend their monies on commericals but it is the only way to get their name out there.",2,0,20180825-054948_621_live
5,"Does this charity help children in the United States, or do they deal mostly with children in African nations?",2,1,20180825-054948_621_live
6,It is a global charity. They help out children in the US and around the world. You should check out their website:  URL s/what-we-do/us-programs,3,0,20180825-054948_621_live
7,I will copy and save the website address.  What do volunteers do for this charity?  I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.,3,1,20180825-054948_621_live
8,My friend is a nurse and she takes a month off every year to go to Africa to help out. I would love to do that but can't possibly get that much time off. How about you?,4,0,20180825-054948_621_live

12,I know money is tight. It sure is for me too. I only ask you to think about whether you buy any unnecessary things like a starbucks coffee every day. I know there are often times I regret spending money on that when there are starving kids in the world that could be helped. Do you ever feel that way?,6,0,20180825-054948_621_live
13,"No, not really.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.  Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.  I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.",6,1,20180825-054948_621_live
14,"I understand. The research team is collecting donations, so if you are willing to give even a few cents from your task payment, I'm sure the charity would be appreciative.",7,0,20180825-054948_621_live
15,"I've done that before on other tasks.  Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?  ",7,1,20180825-054948_621_live
16,"Yes, they are doing what you've described.",8,0,20180825-054948_621_live

3,"That is a great cause. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. Especially animal organizations.",1,1,20180825-081859_875_live
4,While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.,2,0,20180825-081859_875_live
5,that is true. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. How do you feel about animal charities?,2,1,20180825-081859_875_live
6,"This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.",3,0,20180825-081859_875_live
7,That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Or do you donate to other ones also?,3,1,20180825-081859_875_live
8,My charity of choice is Save the Children. I strongly identify with their causes and goals.,4,0,20180825-081859_875_live
9,Do you donate money only? Or do you also volunteer your time?,4,1,20180825-081859_875_live

11,I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. But I do agree with the points you made in support. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?,5,1,20180825-081859_875_live
12,I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. I believe it would be a valuable experience. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?,6,0,20180825-081859_875_live
13,My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. They save miniture IG dogs. I adopted one years ago and she is the best. But children's charities are great too. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?,6,1,20180825-081859_875_live

15,Celebrities often get involved and donate time. It's really cool. I think Disney World participates too.,7,1,20180825-081859_875_live
16,That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. ,8,0,20180825-081859_875_live
17,For sure. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.,8,1,20180825-081859_875_live
18,I definitely agree with all those points. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not. ,9,0,20180825-081859_875_live

6,Save the Children is proud to be named one of the MacArthur Foundation 100&Change Charities with Bold Solutions.,3,0,20180825-090032_956_live
7,This company looks more like a firm than a charity ,3,1,20180825-090032_956_live
8,Every charity needs to be organized in order to help the people it represents.  It is 100% dedicated to helping children.  You can donate as much or as little as you want.  The cost of a cup of coffee even.,4,0,20180825-090032_956_live

13,Thats program services not to the kids themselves. Did they provide housing for kids that went against their culture beliefs?,6,1,20180825-090032_956_live
14,Yes they did. They use  9 out of every 10 dollars spent  towards programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.,7,0,20180825-090032_956_live

Small donations are better than nothing at all!",8,0,20180825-090032_956_live

5,I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.,2,1,20180825-061105_792_live
6,"I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.

I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.",3,1,20180825-061105_792_live
8,"No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  ",4,0,20180825-061105_792_live
9,With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.

I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!,4,1,20180825-061105_792_live

I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.",5,0,20180825-061105_792_live

12,"I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.

14,"If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?",7,0,20180825-061105_792_live

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   ",1,0,20180825-055427_625_live

1,No I havn't. What is it?,0,1,20180903-094154_600_live
2,"It is an organization that helps with children's rights to health, education, and safety. ",1,0,20180903-094154_600_live
3,That sounds like a worthwhile endeavor.,1,1,20180903-094154_600_live
4,I think so too! The organization is currently looking for donations. How much would you be willing to donate to their organization?,2,0,20180903-094154_600_live
5,"I'm not sure. It sounds like something I would be willing to donate to, but I have been fooled before. How much of my donation is actually used for children and how much is lost to administrative costs?",2,1,20180903-094154_600_live
6,"According to their website, 5% of the donation goes to management and general, 9% is fundraising, and the remaining goes to the programs. You can donate directly from your bonus of $2- Can I get a commitment from you for any of the $2 to help the children? ",3,0,20180903-094154_600_live
7,"What does this organisation provide? Is it legal services, or direct medical, educational, and safety products and services?",3,1,20180903-094154_600_live
8,They are advocates for our lower income students and children who have been struck by emergencies. They do a lot with education and all around mental health. You should take a look at their website  URL  There is a lot of beneficial information and ways to help get involved further.,4,0,20180903-094154_600_live
9,"I am currentloy looking at the website. All these programs look good and helpfull, but when providing care and services to children without also ensuring the stability of their familiy or living situation I am dubious about the efficacy of these programs. Making sure a child is free of disease and is well-fed is good, but then tossing them into the street seems counterproductive. I can't seem to find information on how this problem is dealt with.",4,1,20180903-094154_600_live
10,"Based on the other information provided, it does seem that they are consistently there to provide the services for the children therefore I am lead to believe they must have some sort of follow up. The lack of support for the poverty stricken children in the US and in other countries is sad. Programs like this one need our support and voices like yours to make improvements to keep the organizations growing. Your $2 or any donation you decide to make will help the children now and hopefully keep the program growing to learn and do more.",5,0,20180903-094154_600_live
11,I spoke too soon. Just a few clicks after my last statement I found the information I was looking for.

13,I absolutely agree. I am pleased to discover they go all over the world. It appears to be a massive undertaking which they are constantly working to expand. I am pleasantly surprised that they are able to do this without more overhead.,6,1,20180903-094154_600_live

15,I am dismayed to discover that only 7% of thier resources is going into the middle East and Euraisa. With the widespread problems there it seems a small amount. Perhaps it is too dangerous or possibly the local governments won't let them in. Have you seen any information about that?,7,1,20180903-094154_600_live
16,I didn't see that. I'm glad they are able to provide any help. I can't image that it is easy getting to other countries to provide aide. The areas they seem to go to are pretty dangerous. ,8,0,20180903-094154_600_live
17,"Looking att he map of the globe it shows a lot of grayed out areas in the middle east, so it must be a political road block keeping them out. I also noticed only 6% going to Latin America. That also seems low considering the problems that exist in some of those areas.",8,1,20180903-094154_600_live
18,It does. I bet they will eventually be able to raise those numbers as they expand. It will be interesting to watch their growth and how they impact the world. I hope that through our conversations and your research that you have made the decision to make a donation.,9,0,20180903-094154_600_live
19,I have. I feel very good about this Organization and the work they do.

13,Definitely. And I am not doubting that they do good work I was just curious about how they allocate their donations. Going back to the United Way I mentioned earlier they actually let you decide where your donations get put to work. If you would like them to choose for you they have a community fund.,6,1,20180903-142445_603_live
14,"Oh I get that, I guess that will be in the hands of the researchers themselves.  I am sure save the children allows specific donations to go to specific needs, but you would be donating through a ""3rd party"" so to speak.  Would you like to contribute?",7,0,20180903-142445_603_live

4,"Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.

In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.",2,0,20180903-111245_955_live

13,No its not trust about the requestor but I rather have more control over my money than to use electronic versions,6,1,20180903-073450_337_live
14,I like that control also. I can't make any assurances to you that would change your mind. I do ask again that you reconsider since you know it is a good charity.,7,0,20180903-073450_337_live
15,I am sorry but at this point I would rather contribute to them directly.  I love charities that help children and neglected women.  But at this time I would rather contribute to them directly.,7,1,20180903-073450_337_live
16,Do you know that the research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children?,8,0,20180903-073450_337_live

4,"of course we help children all over the world with their education and health, even just donating $1 can really help our cause",2,0,20180903-103431_860_live
5,That sounds great! What is an example project that the charity supports?,2,1,20180903-103431_860_live
6,We give children in Third World countries vaccination from illnesses that are common there. Things like polio which we haven't had in America for a long time still affect the Third World,3,0,20180903-103431_860_live
7,It's tragic that polio is not yet eradicated.  You also mentioned education.  Can you tell me anything about those types of projects?,3,1,20180903-103431_860_live
8,Yes its very tragic. We make sure children have the chance to go to school. In some countries very few girls get to attend school. We support programs that give children the best possible start in life to help their futures.,4,0,20180903-103431_860_live
9,"This does all sound great.  Can you tell me what percentage of each dollar received in donation goes toward these projects, and what goes toward administrative costs, etc.?",4,1,20180903-103431_860_live
10,We have worked very hard to lower out costs and be transparent about how money is used as many people research charities these days to know their donation reach those who need it the most. 94% of all money donate goes towards our causes and 6% goes towards our other costs.,5,0,20180903-103431_860_live

14,"Yes we are supporting education projects in Niger in West Africa, its is one of the poorest countries in the world so having as many educated people as possible in the current generation can really help the country grow and become more affluent.",7,0,20180903-103431_860_live
15,Am I able to direct my donation to a specific project?,7,1,20180903-103431_860_live
16,Yes we allow people to donate to areas and causes that interest. If you donate even a dollar to any of our causes it really helps. A dollar might be chocolate bar or a soda to you but to the people we help its worth so much more.,8,0,20180903-103431_860_live

15,Why should I help these children? Are they not already being helped?,7,1,20180903-093512_147_live
16,"Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.  That is one of the reasons why we are asking for more help.  There are many stories of children who have died from hunger but additional donations would be able to help to quell some of these isolated instances.",8,0,20180903-093512_147_live

12,Yes!  I considered a child through them for several years.  I used to send him Christmas presents and such aloooong with monthly donations.   The two charities are very similar,6,0,20180903-165952_124_live
13,That's wonderful. I actually sponsor three children through them now. Two years ago I was able to go and visit one of the girls I sponsor in Peru.

2,I think you should donate your incoming payment for this take to Save the CHildren.,1,0,20180903-105517_696_live
3,What is the mission of Save the Children?,1,1,20180903-105517_696_live
4,"It's a non government organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. ",2,0,20180903-105517_696_live
5,How much of the money does Save the Children keep for Administrative costs?,2,1,20180903-105517_696_live
6,It is a non profit. So only enough to keep the charity running.  They make a great impact gloabbly.,3,0,20180903-105517_696_live
7,Huh. They are supposed to disclose the percentage. I used to work for a nonprofit. I think Children's International is better.,3,1,20180903-105517_696_live
8,I think they are both great organiations. I don't work for them just am a huge supporter. ,4,0,20180903-105517_696_live
9,Why don't you give to Children's International then?It is around 25.00 a month and you know exactly how you are giving too. I have donated to them for years (a family with two girls-one is Maya and the other is Elizabeth).,4,1,20180903-105517_696_live
10,I personally do give to both. Will you consider giving to both as well?,5,0,20180903-105517_696_live
11,No. I think that giving to one is enough.,5,1,20180903-105517_696_live
12,But think of how many more children you can help. This charity will help more children and obviously you care about children since you already doante to children's international.,6,0,20180903-105517_696_live
13,They can help me. I have a 700.00 car repair and I am two dollars closer to getting it done.,6,1,20180903-105517_696_live
14,"86% of the money goes to programs, 9% fundraising, 5%managing.  THey help in so many ways such as health and nutrition, education, emergency, HIV, hunger and so much more.  ",7,0,20180903-105517_696_live
15,That is great. They can so use your help.,7,1,20180903-105517_696_live
16,They can use your help as well.,8,0,20180903-105517_696_live
17,Yes they can. I think I need my car to make it to work though or I won't be giving to anyone. :],8,1,20180903-105517_696_live

1,"No, I have not heard of save the children. What is that? ",0,1,20180903-165314_834_live
2,Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from?,1,0,20180903-165314_834_live
3,That sounds like a nice organization! Do you know who founded the organization? I am from the United States. ,1,1,20180903-165314_834_live
4,"The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?",2,0,20180903-165314_834_live
5,"Wow, I did not know that they did so much for the children! I honestly am not sure which is the most interesting because honestly they are doing so much goodness in the world. I love that they are making a difference in the young generation. It's interesting that it started during WWI and is still going today. Where are you from ? ",2,1,20180903-165314_834_live
6,"I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?",3,0,20180903-165314_834_live
7,"SC is beautiful, although I have never been there.  I agree that lack of education can cause poverty, and it is a sad thing. Do you think it is hard for certain groups to get out of the poverty line? To me it seems when individuals are born into poverty because parents lack of education, thus leading to their own, it is kind of like a circle. do you believe this as well? I am interested in how I can help these children.",3,1,20180903-165314_834_live
8,"Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?",4,0,20180903-165314_834_live
9,"Wow, I did not even know the specifics of that statistic. I am wondering how much of my donation would go directly to the program, as I know that there are some sketchy organizations out there that pocket the money. Would my donation be split up between different areas of the organization, like some going to education, others to food drives, etc? ",4,1,20180903-165314_834_live
10,"Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?",5,0,20180903-165314_834_live
11,"Yeah, I would like to hear about the programs, what are some of them? ",5,1,20180903-165314_834_live
12,"One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. ""There is no food and we can\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,"" says a terrified child. ""One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,"" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, ""It feels like the end of the world."" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.",6,0,20180903-165314_834_live
13,"Yes, I know about the atrocities happening in Syria right now, and how much it is affecting the children. I honestly can't even imagine going through that, let alone as a child. Even though I myself am not syrian, or know any syrians, it makes me eternally grateful that there are services going to the mental well-being of the children and that is even being considered, because I feel like mental issues tend to get pushed aside. ",6,1,20180903-165314_834_live
14,"Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today?",7,0,20180903-165314_834_live
15,"Okay one last question, where does the other 10% go, if 90% goes to the actual organization? ",7,1,20180903-165314_834_live
16,"Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward",8,0,20180903-165314_834_live
17,I am going to give .50 out of my $2. I hope you understand. ,8,1,20180903-165314_834_live
18,Ok thank you for your donation of $0.50! Taking a bit out of your mturk earnings to do some good in the world!,9,0,20180903-165314_834_live

2,"That is good to hear, barbecue chicken is always good too! I am doing well, just trying to talk to see if you would like to donate to Save the Children. It is an international organization that helps children in developing countries. ",1,0,20180903-134707_882_live
3,Have you donated to the charity?,1,1,20180903-134707_882_live
4,"Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations. ",2,0,20180903-134707_882_live
5,"Yes, I agree, did you grow up with the proper resources?",2,1,20180903-134707_882_live
6,"I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced?",3,0,20180903-134707_882_live
7,"I went to private Catholic school until I was 13, then I went to Public schools which was a much better experience",3,1,20180903-134707_882_live
8,"So you were able to have a good education experience as well. Isn't that something you would like to help other children receive? Anything from $0.01 to $2.00 or any amount you choose, it can go to helping them get an education. ",4,0,20180903-134707_882_live
9,Why is this charity worthy of my money?,4,1,20180903-134707_882_live
10,"Think about how often you buy a pack of gum or a candy bar, something you don't really need but it is because you want it. You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. ",5,0,20180903-134707_882_live
11,"I usually donate to animal shelters,where do you donate ?",5,1,20180903-134707_882_live
12,"What ever charity my grocery store is supporting at the time. Typically children related, sometimes it is for others. It is easy to just add a couple cents on top of my purchase (round up the total) to help their cause. ",6,0,20180903-134707_882_live
13,"yes, that is true I do that often at stores, how did you hear about Save the Children?",6,1,20180903-134707_882_live
14,I was directly contacted by the research team to help get donations for this amazing cause. Helping indirectly is one thing (like through the store) but actually giving when you can be a direct part is so much better. Wouldn't you like to give just $0.50 to this cause? It can provide paper and pencils to a child for school. ,7,0,20180903-134707_882_live
15,".50 would make a difference? that seems so small, not enough to make a difference",7,1,20180903-134707_882_live
16,"Any amount can make a difference, especially when everyone does a small part. ",8,0,20180903-134707_882_live
17,ok I will donate .50 cents I feel compelled to help out ,8,1,20180903-134707_882_live
18,Your donation is greatly appreciated! ,9,0,20180903-134707_882_live

7,Yes I have. Can you tell me how much of the donation actually reaches the children in need?,3,1,20180903-181838_910_live
8,Save the Children donates nearly 90% of every dollar to their mission.  They are very upfront with letting you know where your donation is going.,4,0,20180903-181838_910_live
9,Can I choose where my donation is sent to?,4,1,20180903-181838_910_live
10,Yes not only are you able to choose.  You have the ability to take part in their Sponsor A Child program by either choosing someone in the US or in another country.  I love the idea of staying connected to one or two so that i can see the progress and how I can specifically make a difference.,5,0,20180903-181838_910_live
11,Do I have to make recurring payments?,5,1,20180903-181838_910_live
12,"There's multiple ways to make payments.  Although recurring payments are recommended, it is completely optional.  Would you consider Sponsoring a Child on a long term basis during college?",6,0,20180903-181838_910_live
13,Possibly. I'm not sure if I can afford a long term plan.,6,1,20180903-181838_910_live
14,"The great thing about Save the Children they have the option to even send a gift such as a water kit, a soccer ball and even a rabbit.  I really like this idea because it makes it not all about the money.",7,0,20180903-181838_910_live
15,"That's very nice, I like the idea of sending food or water.",7,1,20180903-181838_910_live
16,"Yes, it is so sad that we have children that still are in need of food and water.  As a single parent of 5 children, I know how rough it can get to provide even the basics but I am still moved to help others because of my own experiences.  Many don't realize just a little can go a long ways.",8,0,20180903-181838_910_live
17,Yes that's very true. How much should a donation be? $1? $10? $100?,8,1,20180903-181838_910_live
18,Of course the more the greater.  I'm the type of give even when it hurts.  I definitely trust Save the Children to do what they say they will to make sure to reach the children.  How much would you be willing to donate?  I remember you saying that you are in college even $2 would help a lot.,9,0,20180903-181838_910_live
19,Yeah I could do a dollar or two.,9,1,20180903-181838_910_live

3,Yes. I have done both.,1,1,20180903-042430_763_live
4,I'm glad to hear that. Charity is very important. Can I ask what kind of organizations you have donated to?,2,0,20180903-042430_763_live
5,A variety ... mostly health related causes.,2,1,20180903-042430_763_live

7,Yes but I don't know much about it. ,3,1,20180903-042430_763_live
8,"Save the Children Promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries. They work in the US and internationally. ",4,0,20180903-042430_763_live
9,That sounds like a very worthy cause.,4,1,20180903-042430_763_live
10,"It is. More impressively, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so donations are used for the cause rather than allocated to profits. ",5,0,20180903-042430_763_live
11,That is pretty impressive but I would rather see more than 90 percent of donations go directly to helping the children.,5,1,20180903-042430_763_live

13,I know international travel is expensive but having 14 percent of the donations going to overhead seems a bit high to me.  It should be no more than 10 percent max.,6,1,20180903-042430_763_live
14,"I understand. But many organization are too scared to go into countries like Syria where children are facing extreme violence. In the first 2 months alone, 1,000 children were killed or injured there. Save the Children does help in this country and others like it. ",7,0,20180903-042430_763_live

3,I know that it is a charity.  I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.,1,1,20180903-103835_253_live
4,Were you aware that Save the Children assists both children in the U.S. as well as foreign countries?,2,0,20180903-103835_253_live
5,No.  I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.  That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!  I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.  ,2,1,20180903-103835_253_live
6,"Yes, not only do we help out with literacy and school related causes, but also with feeding, shelter, and disaster relief for children all over the world.",3,0,20180903-103835_253_live

9,Wow!  That's really great!  I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.  I think this is a fair percentage to have.,4,1,20180903-103835_253_live

12,Both Africa and USA currently have the highest number of children in need.,6,0,20180903-103835_253_live

4,It was relaxing. Sometimes we plan busy weekends but this weekend we stayed home and relaxed. I've actually been reading about Save the Children. Are you familiar with the organization?,2,0,20180903-155911_448_live
5,"Yes I am. It is a very great organization and I believe it was founded by two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

7,That is very true because the way that I see it we are all one big family and should be there for one another in a time of crisis and distress.,3,1,20180903-155911_448_live
8,Yes! I couldn't agree more. We are all in this together. Who knows what we can accomplish if we all do what we can for one another. ,4,0,20180903-155911_448_live

10,"Once again, I couldn't agree more. I was just reading Save the Children is working in Syria. I'm sad to say, they are reporting over 1000 children have died in 2018 in the war. It's horrific to think of children having to live with this sort of fear. ",5,0,20180903-155911_448_live
11,That is both terrible and sad to hear. Syria has a dictatorship and and someone who is obsessed with power. This is a bad combination because a lot of people and especially the most vulnerable like children are getting caught in the crossfire. Its very sad.,5,1,20180903-155911_448_live
12,"It is sad. I'm thinking about sending them a donation. I don't have much of a budget but I suppose every little be helps. If the millions of people just in the US alone contributed $1, that would be quite an infusion of money for Save the Children. ",6,0,20180903-155911_448_live
13,That is correct. If people in the US contribute $1 for Save the Children the world will be indeed a better place. I will do also give a donation. Children must never live in fear and in horrible conditions that they can't escape from.,6,1,20180903-155911_448_live

12,"About 5% goes to administration costs, while about 9% is spent on fundraising efforts. ",6,0,20180903-192755_517_live

7,"yeah. I worked most of the day, but at a pretty slow pace",3,1,20180903-165930_826_live
8,Right on. So back to 'work'. I was wondering if you would be interested in donating a portion of your payment from this task towards a charity called Save the Children,4,0,20180903-165930_826_live
9,i'm familiar with them. how efficient are they as a charity though?,4,1,20180903-165930_826_live
10,Save the Children is extremely efficient. Well as efficient as a charity can be on a count of the donations they receive. Save the Children is not like some other charities you may hear about that have a handsomely paid CEO with small minuscule percentages going to help the needy. ,5,0,20180903-165930_826_live
11,i'd be willing to contribute 50cents,5,1,20180903-165930_826_live

15,that is really great. more people should do that.,7,1,20180903-165930_826_live
16,You learn a lot about people when you put yourself in this sort of position. I know I feel like a better person for volunteering.,8,0,20180903-165930_826_live
17,"how long have you been doing that, and how did you get involved?",8,1,20180903-165930_826_live
18,I've only started recently. My wife and I discussed doing something for other people as a way for the two of us to spend time together. It's a way for us to feel productive or useful in contrast to our normal boring shut-in selves.,9,0,20180903-165930_826_live

2,Save the children helps young ones affected by disasters of all kinds,1,0,20180903-153530_52_live
3,"I see. Are these children specifically from poor countries? Or may it included children affected by, let's say, Hurricane Katrina back in 2005?",1,1,20180903-153530_52_live
4,There is a US Program as well as a global outlet,2,0,20180903-153530_52_live
5,That is good to hear. How specifically will these children be helped? Will the foundation only provide homes? Or is there more to it?,2,1,20180903-153530_52_live
6,"There's definitely more to it STC provides advocacy, education, protection, and food among other services",3,0,20180903-153530_52_live
7,"So it seems that the STC is an all around foundation, aiming to prevent disasters from stunting the progress of young ones. Do you think the foundation is part of the first helpers to a disaster? Or is it a more gradual affect they provide? ",3,1,20180903-153530_52_live
8,The foundation is with children every step of the way from the initial stages of an event to the residual effects months/years later STC looks to help,4,0,20180903-153530_52_live
9,"I do believe being there for every step of the way can really improve the child's chances for success, which is heartwarming. Since I have not heard of the foundation from the start, do you think there impact is less great, than other foundations that are known, such as Red Cross?",4,1,20180903-153530_52_live
10,"Every organization has it's own impact. STC reached 155 million children during 2017 235,000 of which were in the United States. That's a pretty big impact. You can view more stats here  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report",5,0,20180903-153530_52_live
11,"That is a huge impact. I have quickly researched the foundation, and have seen some of these stats. It seems even corporations are involved with the foundation, such as the CEO of Chobani, who believes we should save every child possible. I believe that more companies, like chobani, should partner and donate some of the proceedings they receive to help the children. Do you agree? ",5,1,20180903-153530_52_live
12,Yes I do. Support from corporations would really help in communities across the world,6,0,20180903-153530_52_live
13,"Refering back to the aid STC provides, do you think it is better to provide emergency assistance, just days or weeks after the disaster, or provide gradual assistance after the initial affects of the disaster has been solved? Do you think the foundation needs to pick and choose based on the funding they have?",6,1,20180903-153530_52_live
14,"STC does strive to meet needs at both times, however emphasis is placed on emergency services because it is believed that is when children are most vulnerable. With proper funding we will be able to continue assisting through out the entire process. You can help How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).",7,0,20180903-153530_52_live
15,"That makes a lot of sense, a good basis can propagate to the next few months. I have always been reluctant in donating to such foundations, due to many corruptions in this industry. It is said that most of these foundations are Non-Profit, however, some of these foundations provide false help. I have read that Red Cross showed up at a disaster with empty trucks, just for publicity. How can I know for sure any of these foundations are legit?",7,1,20180903-153530_52_live
16,"I definitely understand Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.   In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.   ",8,0,20180903-153530_52_live
17,"Reports on the financials of the company/foundation is very important, and I appreciate the search for the statistics. I do believe statistics like these can help and persuade people to donate more. I do believe that the government should make such reports mandatory, and even possibly provide a certain status to those foundations that do use a majority of their revenue for the purposes they claim. Do you think the government should involve themselves in such scandals that may occur?",8,1,20180903-153530_52_live
18,Government involvement may be necessary in those cases. Thankfully STC doesn't have anything to worry about in that department. Would you be willing to donate today?,9,0,20180903-153530_52_live
19,"I appreciate the conversation and all the statistics you have given me, however, I will not be donating to said foundation. I believe a good majority of these foundations make false claims.

1,the charity right?,0,1,20180903-235246_719_live

3,Oh. Well I think that the donations that go there are supporting a good cause. Especially for hungry children without food and water,1,1,20180903-235246_719_live
4,"So true. On top of that, they have full financial disclosure of their donations. About 86% goes to program services for less-fortunate kids, and the 14% goes to Fundraising and Management (Personally, I'd like to the latter number go down in the future).",2,0,20180903-235246_719_live
5,Do you think too many people are donating to their charity? Why say that when they are being helped?,2,1,20180903-235246_719_live

14,"Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need. And hey, maybe someday those kids grow up to be some of the most generous, caring people in the world.",7,0,20180903-235246_719_live
15,If its from today I guess I wouldn't mind.,7,1,20180903-235246_719_live
16,"Yeah, it's kind of like money that's not in your pocket yet haha. So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference.",8,0,20180903-235246_719_live
17,"Yeah. I'll go ahead and go with $0.50. Every penny counts. In the future, I would like to donate much more, its one of the promises I've made to myself",8,1,20180903-235246_719_live

13,We do. My mom is on the board for a few nonprofits that we attend fundraisers for. That is a great way to raise money,6,1,20180826-064412_288_live
14,Wow.  Well you've seen charity first-hand.,7,0,20180826-064412_288_live

17,"that is true, but its hard to justify that 30c is going to make any difference",8,1,20180826-064412_288_live

1,Good how are you? ,0,1,20180826-061846_932_live
2,I'm pretty good. Have you ever heard of the Save the Children organization?,1,0,20180826-061846_932_live
3,I have heard of that organization. I have seen a lot of commercials on TV for it. ,1,1,20180826-061846_932_live
4,I hear you. That is when I first heard of it as well. I love the fact that it is a non-government organization that promotes children's rights and helps to provide the support in those developing countries.,2,0,20180826-061846_932_live
5,Agreed. Any organization who promotes rights for those who don't have the platform to speak up is a wonderful charity. ,2,1,20180826-061846_932_live
6,I guess now I am going to sound like the tv commercial but have you ever thought about donating to the organization? ,3,0,20180826-061846_932_live
7,I have thought about it in the past. ,3,1,20180826-061846_932_live
8,"I understand that. With all the organizations out there it is hard to tell a good one and a bad one. This organization helps to children with their rights to health, education, and even safety.",4,0,20180826-061846_932_live
9,"Yes it is hard to tell whose interests really lie in the movement they promote. I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs. ",4,1,20180826-061846_932_live
10,Yeah I totally understand that. I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting. It breaks my heart. ,5,0,20180826-061846_932_live
11,"Absolutely. It makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would I cope? It's the reason I go to work everyday. To make sure that they have all that they need, and more than I ever had. ",5,1,20180826-061846_932_live
12,I completely understand that. I have a little girl and it only makes me want to do more and more for her. Did you know that you can donate a little to the charity today?,6,0,20180826-061846_932_live
13,I did not. ,6,1,20180826-061846_932_live

17,Awesome. I will do that.,8,1,20180826-061846_932_live

11,Ok well I know it is important for them to have basic needs. I hope the money donated goes directly to them and not in the pockets of those running the organization. Are you certain that the money will be used the right way? ,5,1,20180826-073320_803_live

0,How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?,0,0,20180826-220528_999_live
1,"I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.",0,1,20180826-220528_999_live
2,I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?,1,0,20180826-220528_999_live
3,"yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.",1,1,20180826-220528_999_live
4,"It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?",2,0,20180826-220528_999_live
5,"I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.",2,1,20180826-220528_999_live
6,I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?,3,0,20180826-220528_999_live
7,"Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. ",3,1,20180826-220528_999_live
8,I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? ,4,0,20180826-220528_999_live
9,"Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.",4,1,20180826-220528_999_live
10,I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  ,5,0,20180826-220528_999_live
11,"I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.",5,1,20180826-220528_999_live
12,"I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?",6,0,20180826-220528_999_live
13,"Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.

14,"I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time",7,0,20180826-220528_999_live
15,"Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say ""maybe next time"" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so. When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy. ",7,1,20180826-220528_999_live

4,YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to. For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer. I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives. So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.,2,0,20180826-184037_209_live

1,Hello,0,1,20180826-055352_947_live
2,So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children. Have you heard of that charity before?,1,0,20180826-055352_947_live
3,Know I have not. Please explain to me in detail,1,1,20180826-055352_947_live
4,"It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries. It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.",2,0,20180826-055352_947_live
5,Okay. What is the organization called?,2,1,20180826-055352_947_live
6,"It's called Save the Children. It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat. It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat. Do you donate much to charity now?",3,0,20180826-055352_947_live
7,"O I have heard of Save the children. I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity. Currently I do not donate to charities. I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget. I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.",3,1,20180826-055352_947_live
8,"I understand. I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend. I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday. However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out. It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.",4,0,20180826-055352_947_live
9,I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today. I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.,4,1,20180826-055352_947_live
10,"I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding. If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation",5,0,20180826-055352_947_live
11,"Okay. So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?",5,1,20180826-055352_947_live
12,"Yes, I believe so. Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task",6,0,20180826-055352_947_live
13,Okay that is nice and simple. ,6,1,20180826-055352_947_live
14,"Absolutely! I agree. I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do. I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!",7,0,20180826-055352_947_live
15,It has been great to electronically meet you too. I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.,7,1,20180826-055352_947_live
16,"Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns. So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?",8,0,20180826-055352_947_live
17,"So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States. To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children. For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?",8,1,20180826-055352_947_live
18,"I agree. I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless. We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too. I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!",9,0,20180826-055352_947_live
19,"That is cool that you lived in three different states. Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota. There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.  I completely agree with you. I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty. Especially with children. The issue with children poverty has to change.I will take the option of donating into consideration.",9,1,20180826-055352_947_live

1,"Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?   ",0,1,20180826-210609_644_live
2,"Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.",1,0,20180826-210609_644_live
3,I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.,1,1,20180826-210609_644_live
4,They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. ,2,0,20180826-210609_644_live
5,Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  ,2,1,20180826-210609_644_live
6,"Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. ",3,0,20180826-210609_644_live
7,I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.,3,1,20180826-210609_644_live
8,"I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. ",4,0,20180826-210609_644_live
9,It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?,4,1,20180826-210609_644_live

12,"Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :)",6,0,20180826-210609_644_live
13,I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.,6,1,20180826-210609_644_live
14,"You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. ",7,0,20180826-210609_644_live
15,"Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?",7,1,20180826-210609_644_live
16,"Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)",8,0,20180826-210609_644_live

1,I think it's a scam,0,1,20180723-042342_809_live

4,"This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",2,0,20180723-042342_809_live

6,Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.  This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities,3,0,20180723-042342_809_live
7,Like I said those are opinions. There are no facts that prove that to be true. There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either. I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization. Infomercials don't impress me.,3,1,20180723-042342_809_live
8,How about the fact that they have been around for over 100 years scams do not stay around that long ,4,0,20180723-042342_809_live

10,What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?  Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.  They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.  Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?  Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help,5,0,20180723-042342_809_live

16,Yeah there is a bunch of infomercial crap on the top but if you download the actual report then you find the actual financial data.  If you would just agree to donate some of your earnings from this hit them it would go much quicker.,8,0,20180723-042342_809_live
17,"You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something. I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community. ",8,1,20180723-042342_809_live
18,and those local charities they give you their financial info?  There was a shelter in vegas brought in tons of donations cuz they were great yeah right selling any items that were donated and pocketing the cash bigger organizations have more eyes on them,9,0,20180723-042342_809_live

3,"That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.",1,1,20180527-210026_713_live
4,"Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that",2,0,20180527-210026_713_live
5,So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?,2,1,20180527-210026_713_live
6,"Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  ",3,0,20180527-210026_713_live
7,"I feel so silly! Is ""Save the Children"" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching",3,1,20180527-210026_713_live
8,"Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.",4,0,20180527-210026_713_live
9,"Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough",4,1,20180527-210026_713_live
10,Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.,5,0,20180527-210026_713_live
11,"Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?",5,1,20180527-210026_713_live
12, URL here you go,6,0,20180527-210026_713_live
13,Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?,6,1,20180527-210026_713_live
14,"I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club",7,0,20180527-210026_713_live
15,"oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.",7,1,20180527-210026_713_live
16,"Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed",8,0,20180527-210026_713_live
17,"Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.",8,1,20180527-210026_713_live
18,"I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. ",9,0,20180527-210026_713_live

19,Okay. Is this donation tax deductible?,9,1,20180527-123001_539_live
20,These contributions are tax-deductible in the US. Thanks again for choosing to help the children.,10,0,20180527-123001_539_live
0,Good morning. I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested?,0,0,20180807-052301_924_live
1,I have been reading articles about Save the Children charity and I find them quite interesting.,0,1,20180807-052301_924_live
2,"They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.",1,0,20180807-052301_924_live
3,I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.,1,1,20180807-052301_924_live
4,"You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!",2,0,20180807-052301_924_live
5,"I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. ",2,1,20180807-052301_924_live
6,"You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.",3,0,20180807-052301_924_live
7,I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?,3,1,20180807-052301_924_live
8,"Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! ",4,0,20180807-052301_924_live
9,"Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.",4,1,20180807-052301_924_live
10,"If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world!",5,0,20180807-052301_924_live
11,Absolutely. I use Charity Navigator when I decide to make donations. I think it is important for people to look at this when making a decision to donate to any organization.,5,1,20180807-052301_924_live
12,"I think that is very wise to do. Even if you are making a small donation, you want to be sure that it is being used to its fullest potential.",6,0,20180807-052301_924_live
13,Yes. I think this is where some people are lacking in making donations to organizations who don't benefit the greater good. Knowledge is a key factor.,6,1,20180807-052301_924_live
14,"It is a shame that we live in a world where this is an issue, but I think if you make a donation to Save the Children, you can be assured your money will be used to the fullest extent.",7,0,20180807-052301_924_live
15,I agree. I will be making a donation to Save the Children organization.,7,1,20180807-052301_924_live
16,How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.,8,0,20180807-052301_924_live
17,I would absolutely donate the whole amount from this survey. I feel confident that the money would be well spent.,8,1,20180807-052301_924_live
18,Thank you so much. That is a truly nice thing to do and a perfect way to start the day!,9,0,20180807-052301_924_live

1,How's it going today?,0,1,20180807-054926_223_live
2,Great. Have you heard about Save the children charity,1,0,20180807-054926_223_live
3,"No, I have never heard of it, I don't think. Maybe I have and just didn't know it. But can you fill me in on what they do?",1,1,20180807-054926_223_live
4,"Ofcourse. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.",2,0,20180807-054926_223_live
5,"Alright, I see. Can you tell me anything else about them? Anything more specific?",2,1,20180807-054926_223_live
6,I also knew a couple of kids. Oh my god! It is just sad because they died from hunger. So if people make donations. It will be very helpful to avoid situations like that,3,0,20180807-054926_223_live
7,That makes sense. Child suffering is one of the harder tragedies that we'd all probably like to avoid if we could.,3,1,20180807-054926_223_live
8,exactly. I support the organization because I know how good and professional they are. Peoples donations will go to a trustable fund,4,0,20180807-054926_223_live
9,"That's an interesting point you make. Most people's problems with charities is they can never understand how the money is used, if it's used efficiently, how they're trustworthy, etc. It's hard enough to have money to donate, so people want to make sure that, if they do, it's actually making a difference.",4,1,20180807-054926_223_live
10,Right. I feel the same way. I have made donations in the past and I know for a fact that it went to waste. But this organization is just different.,5,0,20180807-054926_223_live
11,Can you tell me specifically how they're different? Do you know?,5,1,20180807-054926_223_live
12,Like I said they use the donations and these go straight to those in need. ,6,0,20180807-054926_223_live
13,"I suppose. I always try to get as information I possibly can so that I can feel as confident about my decision as possible. I don't have a lot of money, so if I were to donate it, I'd need to make sure it went to those that needed it more than I do, and not only have like maybe a small amount actually go to the cause, while the other amount just ends up going into the pockets of CEOs and what-not.",6,1,20180807-054926_223_live
14,Understandable! Here is the website you can visit to gather more information and you will be pleased.  URL  ... Remember we all can be part of the solution. Would you like to make a donation to Save the Childrens /,7,0,20180807-054926_223_live
15,"I think I'd need more time to think about it, and to read through the website, maybe do some internet searches. Like I said, I'm a struggling college student, and most of my money has to go towards rent, food, and school supplies, etc. Thank you for the suggestion, though.",7,1,20180807-054926_223_live
16,No problem. Hopefully you can donate in the future *Small donations mean Big donations* to them also. I wish you the best in your college life :)  ,8,0,20180807-054926_223_live
17,Thank you! I really appreciate that sentiment. And I wish you the same in anything you're doing right now. I like your saying. I will take it to heart and give it serious consideration.,8,1,20180807-054926_223_live

9,"I would be happy to do it, but the requester should have thought the HIT differently: he/she cannot pay me less than the $2.00 that the HIT is worth so I could get $1.50 and donate .50 cents, I should have the HIT rejected and then have another HIT made for me with the value of $1.50",4,1,20180807-193534_716_live

2,I am fine thank you. How bout you.,1,0,20180807-101812_237_live
3,I am good. So we are supposed to be talking about a childrens Charity? ,1,1,20180807-101812_237_live
4,I was thinking of donating part of my earnings for this to Save the Children. I think you should too.,2,0,20180807-101812_237_live
5,"Okay, I might, I do not know anything at all about the charity. ",2,1,20180807-101812_237_live
6,The charity helps support children in developing countries. I will probably give $1 of the payment. What about you?,3,0,20180807-101812_237_live
7,My main consern about donating to children in need is that the donation is going to go to those children.,3,1,20180807-101812_237_live
8,Well they have been around for a long time and on their site it says 9 out of every 10 dollars go to the children I think that they are pretty reputable and most of the money is going where it is needed.,4,0,20180807-101812_237_live
9,That is really great news then I am always concerned that it ever goes to a good place. I would be willing to give some of my money to that cause then.,4,1,20180807-101812_237_live
10,Yea it is a really good cause. Glad you would be willing to give them a donation too.,5,0,20180807-101812_237_live
11,Is there a specific group of people this is going to help or is it just a general fund?,5,1,20180807-101812_237_live
12,I know that you can sponsor a child but other than that it is a general fund that helps children all over the world. ,6,0,20180807-101812_237_live
13,There seems to be almost constant suffering out there now. I have been watching what is happening to Venezuela and it is getting really horrible there ,6,1,20180807-101812_237_live
14,Indeed that is why I think it is important to help out even if it is just giving a small amount of money.,7,0,20180807-101812_237_live

15,The harvest of course. The least favorite thing is weeding. I put back mats down this year and that took care of alot of the weeds. My tomatoes got top rot because of all the rain,7,1,20180902-223320_635_live

3,I believe I have.  The charities that I have donated to are mainly cancer charities.,1,1,20180902-060425_57_live

8,Save the Children is a completely transparent charity that puts most of donations directly toward helping children.,4,0,20180902-060425_57_live
9,That sounds like it is a good charity.  Children need all the help they can get.  All children do not have someone that cares about them and makes sure that they are taken care of.,4,1,20180902-060425_57_live
10,"The lack of help to children around the world has been very tramatic.  In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children in Syria were reported killed or injured.  Your donation can help address these problems.",5,0,20180902-060425_57_live

12,Save the Children is a professional and longstanding organization that has a record of helping children around the world.,6,0,20180902-060425_57_live
13,I feel that we need more organizations like this one.  All children need a chance to be a child and not to be rushed into being an adult at a young age.,6,1,20180902-060425_57_live

6,I was just reading about it. It's actually been around over 100 years and it makes use of donations to support various causes for children around the world.,3,0,20180902-222747_770_live
7,What kinds of causes?,3,1,20180902-222747_770_live

9,Really?  I've never heard of it.  How did you find out about?,4,1,20180902-222747_770_live
10,"Oddly enough, I never heard about it either but I was introduced to it here. I know some HITS make up factitious organizations, but this is actually a real charity, and seems pretty good.",5,0,20180902-222747_770_live

13,"Sure, I'd be willing to do that.",6,1,20180902-222747_770_live
14,"Okay great. How about $0.15? That's 50% of our pay, but it does go to a great cause.",7,0,20180902-222747_770_live
15,"Yes, I would like to do that.  What do we do next?",7,1,20180902-222747_770_live

5,Yes. She had books for school and a few things that she did not have. Her pictures showed her smiling and I do hope that it really helped her.,2,1,20180902-150252_344_live
6,It seems like it is a really good organization. I just saw a really sad picture today of a kid in West Africa working as a mechanic. I wish everyone everywhere had good access to education and that children didn't have to work in other countries.,3,0,20180902-150252_344_live

17,Oh really? I didn't know that either. I was just thinking about asking about that. I feel bad that we have children in our own country that are having a hard time. ,8,1,20180902-150252_344_live
18,"Yes, I was just reading that they are helping still some of the kids affected by Hurricane Harvey.",9,0,20180902-150252_344_live
19,Yes. That was a terrible disaster. It really destroyed a lot of people's lives. I can't believe that they are still trying to come up from it now. ,9,1,20180902-150252_344_live

2,Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children?,1,0,20180902-082346_448_live
3,"Absolutely, I am a little familiar with that orginization....",1,1,20180902-082346_448_live
4,"Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.",2,0,20180902-082346_448_live
5,wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause,2,1,20180902-082346_448_live
6,"That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.",3,0,20180902-082346_448_live
7,"So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?",3,1,20180902-082346_448_live
8,"Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information",4,0,20180902-082346_448_live
9,"Please dont misunderstand... i think you are a little low though.... i think more like 88.3% goes to your programs which is an incredibly great amount by comparison... like i said, I also work in Charity so its very interesting to me",4,1,20180902-082346_448_live
10,"PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. ",5,0,20180902-082346_448_live
11,I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future,5,1,20180902-082346_448_live
12,"I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.",6,0,20180902-082346_448_live
13,you are absolutely correct... if a lot of people donate a little.... its still an astounding amount,6,1,20180902-082346_448_live
14,So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.,7,0,20180902-082346_448_live
15,"I do not have a problem with that at all, as a matter of fact... i've been waiting for you to ask... hahaha",7,1,20180902-082346_448_live
16,"Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?",8,0,20180902-082346_448_live
17,"I do, I was thinking Half of my payment which would be a total donation of $1",8,1,20180902-082346_448_live

3,Please tell me about the charity you work for.,1,1,20180902-040108_507_live
4,It's called Save the Children. Are you familiar with their work?,2,0,20180902-040108_507_live
5,I've heard of the name but don't know much about them. Can you please elaborate on some of the things they do.,2,1,20180902-040108_507_live
6,"They are amazing! They have been around for decades. They work for children's rights to health, education, and safety, especially in poor and developing countries. Children can be terribly exploited for labor and worse.",3,0,20180902-040108_507_live
7,You mentioned they do work in developing countries. How many places do they operate in?,3,1,20180902-040108_507_live
8,They actually work in 120 countries! They are currently helping up to 157 million chidlren!,4,0,20180902-040108_507_live
9,Can you give me some examples of the work they do?,4,1,20180902-040108_507_live
10,"Well for instance, they tackle malnutrition. That's a huge focus of their work. It is stunning how many children have nothing to eat and it actually takes just pennies a day to feed them. ",5,0,20180902-040108_507_live
11,It is very sad that children have to suffer at all. Is there a minimum for a donation?,5,1,20180902-040108_507_live
12,"There is actually no minimum.The great thing is, you can choose to donate up to $2 right now if you would like to do so. ",6,0,20180902-040108_507_live
13,How does the donation process work?,6,1,20180902-040108_507_live
14,"The research team tallies what participants would like to contribute from their task today. You can indicate you would like to donate your payment for this conversation, and the research team handles it from there. ",7,0,20180902-040108_507_live
15,That seems rather simple. I'll give it some thought. But first do they do anything to help children in non developing countries like the United States or Canada?,7,1,20180902-040108_507_live
16,"Yes, they actually do. For example, there are more than 14 million kids in the US growing up in poverty. It's actually 1 in 4 kids in rural America. They run education, protection, and emergency programs to help those kids right here at home. ",8,0,20180902-040108_507_live
17,That is good to hear. Sometimes people tend to forget that we also have issues like that even if we can't see them all the time.,8,1,20180902-040108_507_live
18,"Agree! There are kids in desperate need everywhere. So would you like to commit to donate your payment for just this one task today, up to $2 if there is a bonus? ",9,0,20180902-040108_507_live
19,Yeah I think I will donate. After all every little bit helps.  Is there any way to know how my donation is being used after I donate?,9,1,20180902-040108_507_live

1,"Hello, how are you today? Have you come to talk about the charity?",0,1,20180824-122531_924_live
2,Yes I'm here to talk about an organization called Save The Children. It's a charity you should donate to,1,0,20180824-122531_924_live
3,"Well, why exactly should I donate? There's a lot of charities out there, what makes yours special?",1,1,20180824-122531_924_live

5,"Yes, I have one child. He's four.",2,1,20180824-122531_924_live
6,"Perfect. Now I want you to imagine how your child's life would be if he was alone, bouncing from foster home to foster home. Imagine him with no strong mentor or leader in his life. How does that make you feel?",3,0,20180824-122531_924_live
7,"I would suppose that it would be a rough life, but even if I did want to donate to a children's charity specifically, why would I choose yours out of all of them?",3,1,20180824-122531_924_live
8,You should pick my charity because we pride ourselves on transparency. If you were to give me $0.50 today I could tell you exactly where all the money was to go. You want to know where? It's going straight into a college fund for a foster child. ,4,0,20180824-122531_924_live
9,"If I did decide to donate to you, what would the average donation be? ",4,1,20180824-122531_924_live
10,The average donation is 25 cents to 50 cents. Anything helps,5,0,20180824-122531_924_live
11,"Well, I think I would like to send a donation, but first I still want to know a little bit more. Does every single penny go towards the foster children or does the donation company keep a percentage of the profits?",5,1,20180824-122531_924_live
12,"For all of our donations from individuals, 100% of the proceeds go to the child. The charity runs from larger donations from corporations. ",6,0,20180824-122531_924_live
13,"That's good to hear, I'm feeling more inclined to donate now, but could you first tell me more about who runs the charity operations? or if there's any other uses that this money will go towards outside of college funds?",6,1,20180824-122531_924_live
14,"The charity has a dedicated operations team that has been running the ship for over a decade now. We do take donations for things other than college funds, including: food donations, clothing etc. I just work on the college team",7,0,20180824-122531_924_live
15,"That's fair, well, I guess that it wouldn't hurt to give some money to your charity. How do I go about doing that?",7,1,20180824-122531_924_live
16,"It's pretty easy, the donation can be deducted from your task payment. ",8,0,20180824-122531_924_live

0,Hi,0,0,20180824-121457_149_live
1,Hello,0,1,20180824-121457_149_live
2,I'm here to talk about the charity Save the Children. It is an amazing charity and is very efficient with their funding.,1,0,20180824-121457_149_live
3,"I think I have heard of it, but do not know that much about it aside from a general idea that they support children",1,1,20180824-121457_149_live
4,"They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. This is a really great opportunity for you to donate your bonus without having to actually give money out of your pocket. ",2,0,20180824-121457_149_live
5,"If I am giving money out of my bonus, then it is kind of coming out of my pocket",2,1,20180824-121457_149_live
6,"That is one way to look at it. I think that if you were going to donate at any point, this would be an easy way to do it. Or at least a portion of the bonus. Don't you think donating feels good?",3,0,20180824-121457_149_live
7,Donating doesn't feel good or bad for myself. It is a means to support something if I think the cause is worthwhile and I trust the charity to spend the money in a way I agree with,3,1,20180824-121457_149_live
8,"That is true, the money is making a real and tangible difference regardless of how it makes you feel. I think that everyone should give a little bit here and there because it really adds up and the money can increase their quality of life likely more than it could for you.",4,0,20180824-121457_149_live
9,Why would you think that? You really do not know about me or my situation. The fact that we are on here working on surveys may lend to the fact we need money,4,1,20180824-121457_149_live
10,"That is definitely true I can't make any assumptions about you, you could have kids to feed yourself, etc. But all I'm saying is that most of Save the Children's funding goes to third world nations, really terrible places and war-stricken areas. They just want food and water to be happy.",5,0,20180824-121457_149_live
11,"That may be so, and the charity may do good work, I really do not know. That being said, I would rather keep my own money and donate to the charity in my local area as I see fit rather than support someone across the globe ",5,1,20180824-121457_149_live
12,"Fair enough, but please consider donating even a tiny fraction of the bonus. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.",6,0,20180824-121457_149_live
13,I will keep my bonus and donate $0,6,1,20180824-121457_149_live
14,Can't blame you for that at all.,7,0,20180824-121457_149_live
15,"Good luck in convincing other's though. While I do not choose to donate, I looked up the charity and it does look to be a decent cause. I just believe in working local first and then worrying about international issues",7,1,20180824-121457_149_live
16,"Makes perfect sense, it is sensible to want to help those you're familiar with. The survey should continue at this point I think.",8,0,20180824-121457_149_live
17,"No idea, I have no button to make it progress. One other idea since I have to wait here anyway. If they really want us to give a portion of our bonus then they should probably offer a bit more of one. As it is we make less than 6 an hour if we keep the full bonus",8,1,20180824-121457_149_live
18,"Yeah that was what I was thinking, the base amount is very low. I think it's waiting for 10 messages each so it should continue now. Have a good day!",9,0,20180824-121457_149_live

7,Ok thank you that sounds interesting,3,1,20180824-130913_64_live
8,"yeah, 'cause you know there is a real lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

5,"Oh I never knew you could sponsor a child through them. Although my mum sponsors a child through World Vision, I do not contribute to it. Any other children related charity's you donate to?",2,1,20180824-025834_522_live
6,This is the only one. Theyre pretty awesome as I said. You gotta save those children lol. You can actually donate all or any amount of the bonus you will be rewarded from this hit,3,0,20180824-025834_522_live
7,"True that hahahahaha. However, I am very young and a student with no part time job. This is funding for my items I want to buy from Amazon. However, in the past with my allowances, I donated to UNICEF for kids in third world countries who are unable to purchase study equipment. Are you in a financially high position to be able to donate?",3,1,20180824-025834_522_live
8,"I dont think anyone here is :P Im certainly not! I hear ya, I use this $ to buy vitamins and stuff from amazon too",4,0,20180824-025834_522_live
9,That is very true. I guess if we aren't in a position to donate wealthy sums of money to unfortunate kids we shouldn't even if our minds want to. I would however donate to any charities who help unfortunate kids if I get in the financial position to in the future. Would you?,4,1,20180824-025834_522_live
10,"Yup, totally. I do even now, but not regularly. Are there homeless in/beggars, etc in Australia? Do u ever give to them? Give to the kids instead. A new goat is much better than a Fosters for a wino!",5,0,20180824-025834_522_live
11,Yes their are a lot. I live in the city and I see them on the daily. I do give them some food not money from time to time. I agree that giving the homeless money directly is not the best idea. Do you prioritise children charities or other general charities that help for example the homeless?,5,1,20180824-025834_522_live
12,"I give to homeless, yup, food sometimes (its funny how hungry they suddenly aren't sometimes, when you offer a burger or something) I give em cash too, though I should save all that change and send it to the children. I think it would probably be better spent but I try not to be too judgemental, plus, you know, those guys just come up on ya sometimes, I just automatically give it to em usually.. ",6,0,20180824-025834_522_live
13,Fair enough. I always prioritise children charities as I believe they are important to the future of this world. They are what will make the world a better place and I believe they should all have an equal chance no matter the position they are in. ,6,1,20180824-025834_522_live
14,"Agreed... So, hopefully you'll consider giving even just a little of your bonus to Save The Children at the end. Even just a few cents, multiplied through all the participants could be pretty significant",7,0,20180824-025834_522_live
15,That is very true. Small donations can make a big difference. I will actually consider that. The minimum donation is $2 so that is a potential to donate $2. Where do you think there are the most unfortunate kids?,7,1,20180824-025834_522_live

10,Yes they do I like St Judes Childrens Hospital also ,5,0,20180824-023730_85_live
11,I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people,5,1,20180824-023730_85_live

3,I would prefer to find a charity that assist either in the medical funding side of children's cancer or financial burden assistance to the families of children with cancer. I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?,1,1,20180824-122020_491_live
4,"Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.",2,0,20180824-122020_491_live

8,"Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures.

In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not. ",4,0,20180824-122144_159_live

12,"Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned?",6,0,20180824-122144_159_live

It's a fantastic international, non-governmental organization that promotes the security of childrens' rights and helps to provide relief and support in developing countries.",2,0,20180823-022522_183_live
5,"Yes, I have. I agree that it's a great organization.",2,1,20180823-022522_183_live
6,"It absolutely is! Unfortunately, as with any charitable organization, they do rely on donations and community support to continue providing the resources they do. Without our help, they may not be able to help the children fully. I know there's all kinds of charities nowadays, but trustworthy organizations that advocate for children really touch my heart. I can't ignore them. What about you?",3,0,20180823-022522_183_live
7,"I agree. We have a number of charities here, but it's necessary to check them out carefully because there are a few that are scams or have extremely high administrative costs. I think that the charities for children are the most deserving. Do you donate to Save the Children?",3,1,20180823-022522_183_live
8,"Oh yes I understand. I donate whenever I can (to various charities) and I've certainly been scammed before. I agree, charities for children are most deserving. I have donated to Save the Children and I would again. They're quite a reputable organization that is recognized and utilized domestically and internationally. Charitynavigator.org is a great resource for researching the credibility of organizations like Save the Children. Save the Children is actually rated quite well! On accountability and transperancy, they're rated 97 out of 100, and for financial responsibility they're rated 84 out of 100. Not perfect, but still quite impressive. ",4,0,20180823-022522_183_live

2,My name is Steven.  Do you actively donate to charity?  Have you ever heard of Save the Children?,1,0,20180829-101807_380_live
3,Sorry Steven  I saw your name after I asked.Yes I often monthly really donate to a charity in the Gobi .I have heard and at one point did activly donated to Save The Children.Thank you for asking,1,1,20180829-101807_380_live
4,Save the Children is a wonderful organization.  They promote children's rights and provide relief to support children in developing countries.  Many children around the world benefit from their work.,2,0,20180829-101807_380_live
5,Yes I agree do you donate to Save The Children? I would love to see the children taken from the trafficking aspect and returned to the families.,2,1,20180829-101807_380_live
6,I do donate to Save the Children and I agree with you that human trafficking is something we need to tackle.  It makes me sad that people including children are subjected to such horrors.  Why our world has to have such evil is beyond me.,3,0,20180829-101807_380_live
7,"It is called sin and we CAN do a lot about it by making Save the Children fully accountable for the finances we send ,accountability is very necessary to know where the money is going and if it is being used directly foe the child or administrative fees.",3,1,20180829-101807_380_live
8,I agree and Save the Children provides proof on how they spend their money.  You can view that information on their website.  You can also view reports created by independent resources proving they allocate funds as they say.,4,0,20180829-101807_380_live
9,This is good I also donated to Feed The Children and withdrew my donations when I checked with the accounting agency responsiable for the allocations of the fumds and only a small 10 cents ever went to the child the rest was what they called operating and administrative fees---I was quite angry as we had donated quite a lot.,4,1,20180829-101807_380_live
10,"Wow, that makes me angry when organizations conduct themselves that way.  I understand the need for costs and needing to use some of the money for that.  I like that Save the children specifically states that they use x amount of every dollar.  The financial audits back up their claim.  So I can rest assured that the value of my dollar is going to the children as they promise.",5,0,20180829-101807_380_live
11,So Steven are you going to donate today ?,5,1,20180829-101807_380_live
12,I plan to donate for sure.  I figure that half of my earnings would suffice.  It will help children and I will still benefit.  It seems like a proper thing to do.,6,0,20180829-101807_380_live
13,Sounds good to me I shall also donate 1/2 of my earnings as we are the voice of these precious children I pray they get clean drinking water good food medical treatment housing and all the needs met if we ALL pull together it can be a better world for these children.,6,1,20180829-101807_380_live
14,Looking at the Saving the Children foundation is appears they are doing extensive work in Africa.  What areas of the world do you think could benefit from this organization?,7,0,20180829-101807_380_live
15,Wow that's great what about right here in the USA?There are so many children in poverty here in West Virginia and the other impovished areas.I also see the need in the Gobi desert for good drinking water and medical care.,7,1,20180829-101807_380_live
16,"I agree, I hurt for all children facing bad conditions but in the United States we face a lot too.  It would be nice if they also had a allocation schedule for regions of the world.  By that I mean splitting the funding to include our country and specifically spelling out how much goes to each.f",8,0,20180829-101807_380_live
17,Is Save The Children only internationaly?We need to have a movement to help the children of our country as well as others  Africa has had so much drought and many deaths due to the heat  I am sure they are also in dire straights.,8,1,20180829-101807_380_live
18,It appears they do spend money the US during disasters or other impacting scenarios.  That is good to know.,9,0,20180829-101807_380_live
19,Oh o.k. but it is a disaster in many ways when our own children have no food clean drinking water decent housing but I do understand   so that being said what else do we need to discuss concerning donations?May I add that I was blessed to provid e 2 drinking wells for the Gobi desert and it was and is such a blesing to see the use where they can draw water for the families as well as the livestock  giving is a form of love in many ways.,9,1,20180829-101807_380_live

3,Not right at the moment. I haven't find any good one to donate too.,1,1,20180829-080320_760_live

5,No I have not. What do they do?,2,1,20180829-080320_760_live
6,"They provide health care, education, protection and emergency aid for children all over the world. Nearly 6 million children die each year due to malnourished, lack of care and treatment for preventable diseases, among other things. I was so impressed by their program that I have made them my first choice for donations.",3,0,20180829-080320_760_live
7,"That sounds really good and all, but I'm looking for something that helps our children right here in America. It always seem that charities help other places, but what about the children right here at home.",3,1,20180829-080320_760_live
8,"That was my first question, also, when I started my research, and they are actively involved here, also. Save the Children is an international program so  you can specify  where you want your donation applied.",4,0,20180829-080320_760_live
9,That is awesome. It is just really hard to donate when I have to think of my own family. Not easier to give money to other when I have bills that needs to come first and my own children to think about,4,1,20180829-080320_760_live
10,"I agree. I am also a parent and my family's needs have always come first. I have been able to set aside a very small donation for this organization by telling my kids that they can help another child who is not as fortunate as they are by contributing a small portion of their allowance each week. At first, of course there was grumbling but I showed them pictures of the kids they would be helping and they decided to help.",5,0,20180829-080320_760_live
11,That is very awesome. I don't pay my kids allowance so that wouldn't work for me. I tell them their allowance is the power to play on their tablet and the internet they use.,5,1,20180829-080320_760_live

17,I always like to know how much of the donated amount actually reaches the NGO. Alot of times these organizations have quite a large overhead. ,8,1,20180829-010424_398_live
18,The exact number i am unsure of to be honest. But i know for sure they are caring abd and legitimate.,9,0,20180829-010424_398_live

The governments involved need to come a peaceful resolution before this type of thing stops happening, and if their own government doesnt care enough to fix it how is my money suppose to change that ",5,1,20180829-055223_138_live
12,the donations to the correct people would help them rebuild things and rebuild lives,6,0,20180829-055223_138_live

2,"Pretty good. So the researcher would like us to make a donation to Save the Children. It seems like a good cause, would you like to donate?",1,0,20180829-161850_275_live
3,Absolutely!  Do you know what Save the Children does as a charity?,1,1,20180829-161850_275_live

9,Exactly!  Now I can sleep with a good conscience tonight haha,4,1,20180829-161850_275_live
10,haha thats right. So I looked at a little more info about the charity and apparently they helped a lot with Syrian children that were targets of violence,5,0,20180829-161850_275_live
11,"Oh man, now I wish I could donate more.  But I bet this 2 dollars will go a long way to helping those kids.  Every little bit counts!",5,1,20180829-161850_275_live
12,"Yeah, two dollars doesnt seem like much to us, but its probably a huge help for children in poverty",6,0,20180829-161850_275_live
13,It's horrifying to think about what those kids have been through.  I can't begin to imagine how they must feel right now.  It's not fair they are dealing with their situation at that age when all I was worrying about was who was the most popular kid in class.,6,1,20180829-161850_275_live
14,"I agree. Its hard to even think about living in a place that's violent, impoverished and where every day is difficult. It does make our problems seem pretty trivial",7,0,20180829-161850_275_live

17,Seriously!  It'd be really neat to be able to see how many people donated to the cause,8,1,20180829-161850_275_live
18,"Agreed. Some researchers do send that info out after their studies (maybe they'll see our convo and do it!).  So I think that's our 10 messages. We're agreeing to donate the full amount, right?",9,0,20180829-161850_275_live

14,Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.,7,0,20180829-083014_221_live
15,I assume that comes in the form of a bonus as the task is only .30 to complete. I find it odd though that they don't provide us with a lot of information about the charity to thoroughly discuss it.,7,1,20180829-083014_221_live

2,I'm really good.  I have three children in high school.  I always wanted more children and I think that is why I am so passionate about Save the Children.  Do you donate to any children's charities?,1,0,20180829-082505_548_live
3,"No, I have never donated to any children's charities. I usually donate to other causes.",1,1,20180829-082505_548_live
4,"Personally, I only donate to two causes.  I donate to a local Down Syndrome Organization and Save the Children.  I have found that many charities are making the organizers rich and the money doesn't always go toward causes I believe in.  Have you heard of Save the Children?",2,0,20180829-082505_548_live
5,I have only heard of Save the Children from doing HITs on mTurk.  Its a commonly referenced charity...so much so that I am convinced its not real lol,2,1,20180829-082505_548_live
6,"Lol!  I have seen it several times as well, but I assure you, it is real.  Donations to Save the Children ensure children's right to health, education and safety.  I prefer helping people in my own community, however, I feel that Save the Children is so important to children in the USA and other countries.  Today, I am only looking for a small donation.  Would you ever consider donating to an international organization?",3,0,20180829-082505_548_live

10,Sometimes I doubt what I see on mTurk too!  I wanted to assure you the organization is real.  Did you see that half of refugees are children and 77 cents a day can provide shelter for an entire family?,5,0,20180829-082505_548_live
11,Yeah I did.  Its hard to believe that so little can do so much!,5,1,20180829-082505_548_live
12,"When I saw that, it made me feel terrible.  Just yesterday I spent twice that on a fountain drink at a gas station.  I drank half of it and threw the rest away.  Did you have an amount you were thinking of donating?",6,0,20180829-082505_548_live
13,Yeah its amazing when you think about how much we waste in our day to day lives.  A dollar seems like a good amount to donate. ,6,1,20180829-082505_548_live

17,"OK, its just good to know that Save the Children is actually real",8,1,20180829-082505_548_live
18,I agree.  I always do mTurk hits as a way to save for a family vacation.  I rarely donate when they ask because I'm never sure they are real or if it's a way for the requester to save money.  Thank you so much for your donation and it was nice chatting with you!,9,0,20180829-082505_548_live

3,Okay. Sounds like a good way to raise some money.,1,1,20180829-055552_578_live

9,I donate to the charity twice a year already and today I would like to keep my full bonus.,4,1,20180829-055552_578_live
10,I completely understand and appreciate your past support. I would also like you to think about how your MTurk bonus could be put to good use in places like Syria and Myanmar where there are on going tragedies. You could do a lot of good with the additional donation today.,5,0,20180829-055552_578_live
11,Yes I understand that these are important causes that need donations.,5,1,20180829-055552_578_live
12,"Think of it as giving up a cup of coffee today. I am not sure where you live, but I am in New York and you would be hard pressed to get a cup of coffee for $2.

13,Yes - I am sure that $2 dollars would be able to accomplish a lot more through Save the Children.,6,1,20180829-055552_578_live
14,"Not only that, but think about it in the bigger picture. When all MTurk workers contribute their bonus payment today, it adds up to a lot of money very quickly. While you may think your $2 is not that much, when it is put together with all the other generous donations from MTurk workers, it really adds up quickly.",7,0,20180829-055552_578_live
15,I didn't think about it like that. This is something to consider. It would be a nice-sized donation.,7,1,20180829-055552_578_live
16,It really would. Your $2 along with everyone else's can make a big difference in the lives of other people. Would you reconsider your earlier decision?,8,0,20180829-055552_578_live
17,"I don't think that I will donate anything today, sorry.",8,1,20180829-055552_578_live
18,Can I ask what you will be using your $2 for than? It seems like such a small amount that it should be easy to make the donation and not have it impact you greatly.,9,0,20180829-055552_578_live
19,It will be put into savings along with my other mturk money.,9,1,20180829-055552_578_live

4,Save the Children is a non-governmental organization that operates world-wide fighting for children's rights and helps those children in developing countries. ,2,0,20180829-212706_883_live
5,That is an important issue to address. How does the organization achieve this?,2,1,20180829-212706_883_live

15,It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.,7,1,20180808-032124_114_live
16,Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping. So you will really get to know that one child.

11,"That's not a bad percentage considering, but isn't non-profit supposed to be volunteers?",5,1,20180830-232642_468_live
12,"No, non-profits can have paid employees, and many charities when they reach a certain size need them to organize things.  Just that in non-profits, the compensation must be reasonable, and you can have passive investors that get paid who don't engage in any employment activities at the company.",6,0,20180830-232642_468_live

1,Hi,0,1,20180830-154630_337_live
2,So I am supposed to persuade you to donate all thirty of your cents to a charity called Save the Children,1,0,20180830-154630_337_live
3,"Oh, I believe I've heard of them. What kind of work do they do?",1,1,20180830-154630_337_live
4,"They promote childrens rights, provide relief and helps support children in developing countries",2,0,20180830-154630_337_live
5,Do you know if they keep track of the effectiveness of their interventions?,2,1,20180830-154630_337_live
6,I believe they do. They also help fund education for children,3,0,20180830-154630_337_live
7,"That sounds admirable. I usually donate to global health charities (like the Against Malaria Foundation) because it's highly cost effective. Policy intervention is also important, but it's harder to know if it's worthwhile/will be successful...",3,1,20180830-154630_337_live
8,Totally understandable. It is easier to donate to something when there is tangible evidence of its success. I think helping children have access to an education will be beneficial to the entire world in the long run,4,0,20180830-154630_337_live
9,"By the way, on my side I'm told I can donate anything from $0-$2. So donating $0.30 sounds reasonable.",4,1,20180830-154630_337_live
10,"I think that is very reasonable, and every little bit helps. ",5,0,20180830-154630_337_live
11,I would be interested to know what different programs their funding goes towards. Do they publish a budget?,5,1,20180830-154630_337_live
12,"They actually do, I just looked on their website. It has a lot of information that I didnt expect them to make public",6,0,20180830-154630_337_live
13,That's great! It's encouraging when a charity is transparent. I assume it's a 501.3(c)?,6,1,20180830-154630_337_live
14,"It looks like it, only 5% of their donations go to management so I believe they operate as a non profit. Which is wonderful",7,0,20180830-154630_337_live
15,Do you have a favorite non-profit? :P,7,1,20180830-154630_337_live
16,I should probably say this one but I donate to animal shelters mainly haha,8,0,20180830-154630_337_live
17,"Oh nice. I'd also like to look into donating more to animal welfare charities. I know there's some philosophical disagreement about this, but I prefer to diversify my charitable 'investments' as it were.",8,1,20180830-154630_337_live
18,"That makes sense! So, you felt like donating 30 cents was fair?",9,0,20180830-154630_337_live

Last year, many children died from hunger because we did not get enough donations to fully feed their families.

It's sick and financial donation is the best way to help besides going there yourself",9,0,20180830-191022_810_live

13,Can you tell me about it?,6,1,20180830-174339_981_live
14,"Sure.  Save the Children gives children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. They do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we all share.  They are a worldwide organization and I believe even assisted with the response to Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year.",7,0,20180830-174339_981_live

17,How much of the donation goes directly to the children?,8,1,20180830-174339_981_live
18,100% of your donation goes to it according to the creators of this Turk.  You can donate any amount of your bonus and the rest of the bonus is yours to keep.  I even use a Chome extension call Tabs for a Cause and donate to them through that extension all the time,9,0,20180830-174339_981_live
19,No non profit can give 100% of the donation to the intended recipient. There are costs to take care of first.,9,1,20180830-174339_981_live
20,"Yeah, that\'s true.  The only information I have to work with in regards to how much of this particular donation that goes to the children is what the research organizers say: ""The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.""  However, according to Charity Navigator, 88.3% of their donations go to their mission (the children).",10,0,20180830-174339_981_live

3,"I think it is a great idea, however I am unable to donate at this time!I am also skeptical about making online donations! ",1,1,20180830-185816_181_live
4,Well it is easy and they will just take it out of our pay.,2,0,20180830-185816_181_live

6,Definitely; it is a worthy cause,3,0,20180830-185816_181_live
7,That is awesome for you! I will not be making a donation today! Honestly I believe this chat is to gain money (donations) and not to discuss social issues. Based on your responses Im sure your not a random person. So how often do you actually get people to make the donations?,3,1,20180830-185816_181_live
8,It is actually kind of hard. Many do not see the need or care.,4,0,20180830-185816_181_live
9,Social media might be a better platform for gaining donations. I would actual consider making a donation that way because it appears more trustworthy,4,1,20180830-185816_181_live
10,"If that works for you, sure. I would be happy with that, because the need is so large. Our government is doing almost nothing to help children in need.",5,0,20180830-185816_181_live
11,I would have to agree with this statement. What comes to mind when I think about kids in need and the government is the need to provide free lunches for all students. ,5,1,20180830-185816_181_live
12,"Well yes. They can need much more than that, unfortunately. Fresh water and clothing is often not available in the third world.",6,0,20180830-185816_181_live

14,"It is up to us to help, a situation that probably will continue regardless of who is in charge of our government.",7,0,20180830-185816_181_live
15,"Yes, it is cliche but we can make a difference. Of course, donations play a major role in helping! No, I am still not donation today!",7,1,20180830-185816_181_live
16,Alright. You could visit the Save The Children website. It is very interesting and informative.  URL ,8,0,20180830-185816_181_live
17,"Yes, I will thank you for providing the website!",8,1,20180830-185816_181_live
18,I can just tell you that helping is very satisfying. Doing something that matters. You could consider it a hobby like golf or a book club.,9,0,20180830-185816_181_live
19,"Agreed, I love helping others. I often donate goods and food to help others. I am always willing to donate my time to support great causes!

7,I guess it's a lot better way to waste time than seeing what a bunch of people I don't really care about are doing.  So when college is in there's less competition?  ,3,1,20180901-071043_291_live

12,"On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better",6,0,20180901-071043_291_live

14,"Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called ""Save the Children""",7,0,20180901-071043_291_live

17,I think so.  How do you see where the donation goes?  ,8,1,20180901-071043_291_live
18,It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids. Even a small donation makes a big difference because there are so many of us making small amounts that it really adds up!,9,0,20180901-071043_291_live
19,That's great.  Certainly something that needs to be done.  Have you had the opportunity to travel a lot?  I recently went to Africa and it gave me a new perspective on life.,9,1,20180901-071043_291_live

8,Yeah! It's ranked really highly among other nonprofit organizations. Their independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars they spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.,4,0,20180901-063841_657_live
9,I'm delighted to learn that! ,4,1,20180901-063841_657_live
10,"Yes! They've helped 157 million children in 120 countries. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.

Through Save the Children's education, protection and emergency programs, they reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone.",5,0,20180901-063841_657_live
11,You've hit on one of my concerns.  I worry about American children (since I live there). But it's not just rural kids who have needs.  Children in urban areas are sometimes at risk as well. Does Save the Children address that area?,5,1,20180901-063841_657_live
12,"That's definitely true. Save the Children targets America's most isolated and underserved children. 20% of children in the US grows up in poverty; of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural, which is why rural America is a focus for this organization. It doesn't mean that children in urban areas aren't important too, of course!",6,0,20180901-063841_657_live
13,That's true. Every child matters and every child's parent(s) too! I love the wonder that kids have for almost everything! And they can't experience joy if their bellies are empty.,6,1,20180901-063841_657_live

1,"Hello, I donate here and there but not on a regular basis",0,1,20180901-075346_269_live
2,I understand! It is nice that you do give to charities because every little bit helps. Have you heard of the organization Save the Children?,1,0,20180901-075346_269_live
3,Yes . I've heard about it but I would like to have more information,1,1,20180901-075346_269_live
4,"Sure, they are an international organization not connected to any government that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support to children in developing countries.",2,0,20180901-075346_269_live
5,"Interesting, in how many countries do they work?",2,1,20180901-075346_269_live
6,Right now they are in 120 countries and have helped 33.3 million children directly. I am partial to children's charities because they help the ones who can't really help themselves.,3,0,20180901-075346_269_live
7,"So nice, what are the main issues they work on? ",3,1,20180901-075346_269_live
8,"They provide better healthcare and education for children as well as providing emergency aid when natural disasters occur or war and other conflicts. Did you know in Jan and Feb alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria due to violence in that country?",4,0,20180901-075346_269_live
9,I've heard about it. It breaks my heart. is this organization clear with its financial reports?,4,1,20180901-075346_269_live
10,"Yes in fact the most recent rating of Save the Children by a non profit charity watchdog gave it an ""A"". I think that is pretty clear.",5,0,20180901-075346_269_live
11,That is so good to find a trustworthy charities. I think there should be a few well-known companies cooperating with this charity,5,1,20180901-075346_269_live
12,"I agree. I think more people need to get on board to help the children. If we all do a little by sacrificing that 1 coffee a week or by eating out one time less per week, we could all make more of a difference, right?",6,0,20180901-075346_269_live
13,"right, every little help make a big difference. we can support a family with few dollars in some countries",6,1,20180901-075346_269_live
14,"That is true for sure. I'm going to give some of my earnings today to STC, would you be willing to give some also if only $.25?",7,0,20180901-075346_269_live

10,We will be setting up a pseudo- children's hospital. More like a nurses station to help sick kiddos in remote villages.,5,0,20180901-075720_707_live

There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities. ",4,1,20180827-033057_106_live

11,"Yea, I think thats most important. There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need. I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities. Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?",5,1,20180827-033057_106_live

13,Ive had a few of the charity HITs. I like to learn about an array of different things. I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs. Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here. I have a cousin who works with MercyShip. They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.,6,1,20180827-033057_106_live

17,Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities. I cant even imagine what these poor families go through. McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay. Ronald McDonald House is the name I think. ,8,1,20180827-033057_106_live

6,"It's an organization that raises money for children all over the world in need, such as children from war torn countries like syria",3,0,20180827-050740_909_live
7,I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.,3,1,20180827-050740_909_live
8,"See, I believe that the children are our future. If we don't help them now, they won't have the life they deserve. One could be the next president or something!",4,0,20180827-050740_909_live

13,That would be real low on my list of priorities.  People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.,6,1,20180827-050740_909_live
14,Well i hear you. I think that any donation to anyone is helpful in this world. It should be specialized,7,0,20180827-050740_909_live
15,I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.  Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.,7,1,20180827-050740_909_live
